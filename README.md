# Datafest

This is what our teram produced in 2 days for Champmans Datafest Comeptition. We analyzed data given from indeed.com. Data file too large to upload. 

Problem: Indeed gets complaints from their clients because they get bad applicants but the companies still have to pay the sponsored rate.
Only a low percentage actaully fit job descriptions made by companies. 

Solution: Indeed gives advice to clients on what features they should change in order to get more qualified applicants. Easily apply for sponsored listings benefits indeed because the clients pay per click. However, it could also attract applicants who may not be as qualified, thus causing the clients to lose money.

What we found:

1. Best time to apply to jobs

2. When companies are most seeking for hires

3. Most listing for jobs in the U.S. was for: nurses, food, retail, and management

4. Locations to move to for best oppertunity of being hired

5. Community college and private schools in CA have the upper hand because their school startes earlier(the same time jobs are seeking people to hire).
